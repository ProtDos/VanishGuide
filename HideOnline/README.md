## How to hide online?

### How to avoid catastrophic data leaks:
* Use Burners, phones that are one-time only. These are old phones you can throw away if you did anything wrong or exposed your location.
* Use temporary mail services, as seen in "UsefulLinks"
* For temporary phone service, try using "Google Voice" - US and CA only.
* https://privacy.com lets you create 12 burner credit cards each month for free

### Hide your identity:
* Use anonymous browsers like TOR to surf the web securely
* Delete your personal information on the web. You can do this manually or pay for a service. Check [LifeWire](https://www.lifewire.com/remove-personal-information-from-internet-3482691) out for more information.
* Delete and Hide Your Search Habits
* Use a Junk Email Account to Handle New Account Details
* Avoid Giving Out Your Real Payment Details
* Use RSS to Hide Your Tracks
* Delete Spyware to Stay Hidden Online
* Upgrade Your Social Media Privacy Settings (or don't havy any social media, it's that easy)
* Log Out of Websites When You're Done
